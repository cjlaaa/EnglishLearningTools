`An incredible journey.
IN OCTOBER 1604, something remarkable appeared in the night sky. Without warning, a light brighter than any star suddenly lit up the darkness. Early astronomers saw it as a miraculous portent of things to come. None of them guessed what it really was - the dying light of a distant star that had exploded thousands of years before.
Now known as Kepler's Star after the astronomer who watched it for more than a year, the supernova helped to usher in a new era of space exploration. Within a few years Galileo Galilei was pioneering the use of the telescope, using one he'd designed himself to observe hills and valleys on the moon, spots on the sun, the phases of Venus, the stars of the Milky Way and, most famously, the satellites of Jupiter. Tycho Brahe, Christian Huygens and other greats of early astronomy were soon making discoveries of their own.
We are still in the golden age of discovery kick-started by these pioneers. We now have telescopes the size of football fields peering deeper into space than Kepler could have imagined. And for the past 60 years we have been sending satellites, craft, probes, humans and instruments into space to get an even closer look. Right now, the Curiosity rover is sending back snapshots from the surface of Mars and the Philae lander is hitchhiking out of our solar system aboard a passing comet.
Thanks to these tools of exploration our knowledge of the cosmos is constantly expanding all the time. As just one example, when the European Space Agency's Gaia mission finishes in 2018, its telescope will have photographed over a billion stars, providing us with the most accurate three-dimensional map of the heavens ever drawn.The memory of the swashbuckling race to the moon may be fading, but space exploration is as vibrant as ever.
This issue of New Scientist: The Collection roams the frontiers of that inspirational quest.
It will illuminate some of the deepest mysteries of the universe and help you see our own cosmic corner in astonishing detail.
Chapter 1 takes a journey around our solar system. Meet the robots climbing the mountains of Mars, visit some of our neighbourhood's most unusual moons, stare at the surface of the sun and get to know the spacecraft struggling to cross the solar system's last horizon.
Chapter 2 widens the aperture to explore our home galaxy, the Milky Way. We no longer think it is the entire universe, but still many of its secrets elude us, from the black hole at its centre to the stars that may have formed alongside our sun.
Chapter 3 returns to more familiar - if still very alien - territory in the shape of the Earth-like planets that may be strewn across the cosmos. What strange worlds are they? Are they - or their moons - capable of supporting intelligent life? And how would we know what to look for?
Finally, Chapter 4 plunges into the depths of space to check out some of its most unusual inhabitants, from the galaxies too perfect to exist to the stars larger than we thought possible.
We may no longer rely on the naked eye to scan the heavens, but there's plenty we still don't know. Let New Scientist take you to the very limits of our knowledge, and guide you through the questions that will power the next centuries of discovery.

`Wild things.
Life on Earth, Charles Darwin wrote in On the Origin of Species, is full of "endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful". Anyone who has visited a rainforest, a coral reef or even an English meadow knows what he was talking about.
Life is dazzling, fecund, diverse and yet fragile.
Earth is the only planet we know where it exists, and we are right to exult in it.
This issue of New Scientist: The Collection is dedicated to Earth's stunning, fascinating and most fragile wildlife. From the tropics to the poles, the depths of the oceans to the peaks of the Himalayas, life is everywhere.
In these pages you'll encounter the most interesting organisms the planet has to offer complemented with stunning wildlife photography.
We begin, in Chapter 1, with our own kin: the mammals. From the plight of the rarest primates to the extraordinary social bonds of some of the largest animals on Earth, these are tales of survival, recovery and, in some cases, extinction. Pulling the stories together, it is possible to see a glimmer of hope for the 26 remaining Hainan gibbons in the remarkable comebacks of Europe's large predators and Canada's adorable sea otters. Or will they go the way of the world's largest ape and the mysterious wolf of the south Atlantic?
In Chapter 2, we take to the skies. Birds are no less fascinating than mammals, and in some cases equally imperilled. One particularly poignant story is the operation to save the Chatham Island black robin, a heroic and successful effort - although it did have a strange effect on the bird's eggs. You'll also meet pelicans, cormorants, wild turkeys and an owl that appears to be horribly lost.
Chapter 3 is all about the oceans and the fascinating beasts that live in it. Did you know that by eating vast quantities of fish and krill, whales make the oceans richer not poorer?
That a sly red devil is taking over the eastern Pacific? Or that one of the most valuable materials on Earth is rotten marine excrement? One of our writers has gone hunting for it, so you don't have to.
Chapter 4 brings us back to earth with an exploration of some of the most peculiar plants the planet has to offer. Some are carnivorous and seem to draw in small bats and shrews. Others, incredibly, show signs of intelligence.
Chapter 5 is dedicated to the cold, slimy and yet oddly endearing. We learn that the "Lazarus frogs" offer hope for a group of animals that has been decimated by a ferocious fungus, and then head to the Balkans on a quest to find the world's largest and fiercest cave dweller (spoiler alert: it is neither very large nor very fierce, but incredibly rare). Along the way, we learn a thing or two about where snakes come from and how turtles find their way home.
The weirdest and most wonderful wild things are saved for last. Chapter 6 is all about the extremes, from the Arctic Ocean's very own sea unicorns to the tiniest geckos, fish and frogs, which fit on a human fingernail.
What is the biggest organism on Earth? The oldest? The driest? All will be revealed.

`Where must the puma have come from?
Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.
The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside`,

`The people in the back, can you hear me clearly? OK, good. Have you ever held a question in mind for so long that it becomes part of how you think? Maybe even part of who you are as a person? Well I've had a question in my mind for many, many years and that is: How can you speed up learning? Now, this is an interesting question because if you speed up learning, you can spend less time at school. And if you learn really fast, you probably wouldn't have to go to school at all. Now, when I was young, school was sort of OK but, I found quite often that school got in the way of learning so I had this question in mind: How do you learn faster? And this began when I was very, very young, when I was 11 years old, I wrote a letter to researchers in the Soviet Union, asking about hypnopaedia, this is sleep-learning, where you get a tape recorder, you put it beside your bed and it turns on in the middle of the night when you're sleeping, and you're supposed to be learning from this. A good idea, unfortunately it doesn't work. But, hypnopaedia did open the doors to research in other areas and we've had incredible discoveries about  learning that began with that first question. I went on from there to become passionate about psychology and I have been involved in psychology in many different ways for the rest of my life up until this point. In 1981, I took myself to China and I decided that I was going to be native level in Chinese inside two years. Now, you need to understand that in 1981, everybody thought Chinese was really, really difficult and that a Westerner could study for 10 years or more and never really get very good at it. And I also went in with a different idea which was: taking all of the conclusions from psychological research up to that point and applying them to the learning process. What was really cool was that in six months I was fluent in Mandarin Chinese and it took a little bit longer to get up to native. But I looked around and I saw all of these people from different countries struggling terribly with Chinese, I saw Chinese people struggling terribly to learn English and other languages, and so my question got refined down to: How can you help a normal adult learn a new language quickly, easily and effectively? Now this is a really, really important question in today's world. We have massive challenges with environment, we have massive challenges with social dislocation, with wars, all sorts of things going on and if we can't communicate, we're really going to have difficulty solving these problems. So we need to be able to speak each other's languages, this is really, really important. The question then is: How do you do that? Well, it's actually really easy. You look around for people who can already do it, you look for situations where it's already working and then you identify the principles and apply them. It's called modelling and I've been looking at language learning and modelling language learning for about 15 to 20 years now. And my conclusion, my observation from this is that any adult can learn a second language to fluency inside six months. Now when I say this, most people think I'm crazy, this is not possible. So let me remind everybody of the history of human progress, it's all about expanding our limits. In 1950, everybody believed that running one mile in four minutes was impossible, and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956 and from there it's got shorter and shorter. 100 years ago everybody believed that heavy stuff doesn't fly. Except it does and we all know this. How does heavy stuff fly? We reorganise the material using principles that we have learned from observing nature, birds in this case. And today we've gone even further, We've gone even further, so you can fly a car. You can buy one of these for a couple 100000 US dollars. We now have cars in the world that fly. And there's a different way to fly which we've learned from squirrels. So all you need to do is copy what a flying squirrel does, build a suit called a wing suit and off you go, you can fly like a squirrel. Now most people, a lot of people, I wouldn't say everybody but a lot of people think they can't draw. However there are some key principles, five principles, that you can apply to learning to draw and you can actually learn to draw in five days. So, if you draw like this, you learn these principles for five days and apply them and after five days you can draw something like this. Now I know this is true because that was my first drawing and after five days of applying these principles that was what I was able to do. And I looked at this and I went: "Wow, so that's how I look like when I'm concentrating so intensely that my brain is exploding." So, anybody can learn to draw in five days and in the same way, with the same logic, anybody can learn a second language in six months. How? There are five principles and seven actions. There may be a few more but these are absolutely core. And before I get into those I just want to talk about two myths, I want to dispel two myths. The first is that you need talent. Let me tell you about Zoe. Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, was trying to learn Dutch, struggling extremely, extremely, a great deal and finally people were saying: "You're completely useless," "you're not talented," "give up," "you're a waste of time" and she was very, very depressed. And then she came across these five principles, she moved to Brazil and she applied them and in six months she was fluent in Portuguese, so talent doesn't matter. People also think that immersion in a new country is the way to learn a language. But look around Hong Kong, look at all the westerners who've been here for 10 years, who don't speak a word of Chinese. Look at all the Chinese living in America, Britain, Australia, Canada have been there 10, 20 years and they don't speak any English. Immersion per se does not work. Why? Because a drowning man cannot learn to swim. When you don't speak a language, you're like a baby. And if you drop yourself into a context which is all adults talking about stuff over your head, you won't learn. So, what are the five principles that you need to pay attention to? First: the four words, attention, meaning, relevance and memory, and these interconnect in very, very important ways. Especially when you're talking about learning. Come with me on a journey through a forest. You go on a walk through a forest and you see something like this, Little marks on a tree, maybe you pay attention, maybe you don't. You go another 50 metres and you see this, You should be paying attention. Another 50 metres, if you haven't been paying attention, you see this, And at this point, you're paying attention. And you've just learned that this, is important, it's relevant because it means this, and anything that is related, any information related to your survival is stuff that you're going to pay attention to and therefore you're going to remember it. If it's related to your personal goals, then you're going to pay attention to it. If it's relevant, you're going to remember it. So, the first rule, first principle for learning a language is focus on language content that is relevant to you. Which brings us to tools. We master tools by using tools and we learn tools the fastest when they are relevant to us. So let me share a story. A keyboard is a tool. Typing Chinese a certain way, there are methods for this. That's a tool. I had a colleague many years ago who went to night school; Tuesday night, Thursday night, two hours each time, practicing at home, she spent nine months, and she did not learn to type Chinese. And one night we had a crisis. We had 48 hours to deliver a training manual in Chinese. And she got the job, and I can guarantee you in 48 hours, she learned to type Chinese because it was relevant, it was meaningful, it was important, she was using a tool to create value. So the second principle for learning a language is to use your language as a tool to communicate right from day one. As a kid does. When I first arrived in China, I didn't speak a word of Chinese, and on my second week, I got to take a train ride overnight. I spent eight hours sitting in the dining car talking to one of the guards on the train, he took an interest in me for some reason, and we just chatted all night in Chinese and he was drawing pictures and making movements with his hands and facial expressions and piece by piece by piece I understood more and more. But what was really cool, was two weeks later, when people were talking Chinese around me, I was understanding some of this and I hadn't even made any effort to learn that. What had happened, I'd absorbed it that night on the train, which brings us to the third principle. When you first understand the message, then you will acquire the language unconsciously. And this is really, really well documented now, it's something called comprehensible input. There's 20 or 30 years of research on this, Stephen Krashen, a leader in the field, has published all sorts of these different studies and this is just from one of them. The purple bars show the scores on different tests for language. The purple people were people who had learned by grammar and formal study, the green ones are the ones who learned by comprehensible input. So, comprehension works. Comprehension is key and language learning is not about accumulating lots of knowledge. In many, many ways it's about physiological training. A woman I know from Taiwan did great in English at school, she got A grades all the way through, went through college, A grades, went to the US and found she couldn't understand what people were saying. And people started asking her: "Are you deaf?" And she was. English deaf. Because we have filters in our brain that filter in the sounds that we are familiar with and they filter out the sounds of languages that we're not. And if you can't hear it, you won't understand it, if you can't understand it, you're not going to learn it. So you actually have to be able to hear these sounds. And there are ways to do that but it's physiological training. Speaking takes muscle. You've got 43 muscles in your face, you have to coordinate those in a way that you make sounds that other people will understand. If you've ever done a new sport for a couple of days, and you know how your body feels? Hurts? If your face is hurting, you're doing it right. And the final principle is state. Psycho-physiological state. If you're sad, angry, worried, upset, you're not going to learn. Period. If you're happy, relaxed, in an Alpha brain state, curious, you're going to learn really quickly, and very specifically you need to be tolerant of ambiguity. If you're one of those people who needs to understand 100 percent every word you're hearing, you will go nuts, because you'll be incredibly upset all the time, because you're not perfect. If you're comfortable with getting some, not getting some, just paying attention to what you do understand, you're going to be fine, relaxed, and you'll be learning quickly. So based on those five principles, what are the seven actions that you take? Number one: Listen a lot. I call it brain soaking. You put yourself in a context where you're hearing tons and tons and tons of a language and it doesn't matter if you understand it or not. You're listening to the rhythms, to patterns that repeat, you're listening to things that stand out. (Chinese) Pào nǎozi. (English) So, just soak your brain in this. The second action is that you get the meaning first, even before you get the words. You go: "Well how do I do that? I don't know the words!" Well, you understand what these different postures mean. Human communication is body language in many, many ways, so much body language. From body language you can understand a lot of communication, therefore, you're understanding, you're acquiring through comprehensible input. And you can also use patterns that you already know. If you're a Chinese speaker of Mandarin and Cantonese and you go to Vietnam, you will understand 60 percent of what they say to you in daily conversation, because Vietnamese is about 30 percent Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese. The third action: Start mixing. You probably have never thought of this but if you've got 10 verbs, 10 nouns and 10 adjectives, you can say 1000 different things. Language is a creative process. What do babies do? OK, "me", "bath", "now". OK, that's how they communicate. So start mixing, get creative, have fun with it, it doesn't have to be perfect, just has to work. And when you're doing this, you focus on the core. What does that mean? Well, any language is high frequency content. In English 1000 words covers 85 percent of anything you're ever going to say in daily communication. 3000 words gives you 98 percent of anything you're going to say in daily conversation. You got 3000 words, you're speaking the language. The rest is icing on the cake. And when you're just beginning with a new language, start with your tool box. Week number one, in your new language you say things like: "How do you say that?" "I don't understand," "repeat that please," "what does that mean?" all in your target language. You're using it as a tool, making it useful to you, it's relevant to learn other things about the language. By week two, you should be saying things like: "me," "this," "you," "that," "give," you know, "hot," simple pronouns, simple nouns, simple verbs, simple adjectives, communicating like a baby. And by the third or fourth week, you're getting into "glue words." "Although," "but," "therefore," these are logical transformers that tie bits of a language together, allowing you to make more complex meaning. At that point you're talking. And when you're doing that, you should get yourself a language parent. If you look at how children and parents interact, you'll understand what this means. When a child is speaking, it'll be using simple words, simple combinations, sometimes quite strange, sometimes very strange pronunciation, other people from outside the family don't understand it. But the parents do. And so the kid has a safe environment, gets confidence. The parents talk to the children with body language and with simple language they know the child understands. So you have a comprehensible input environment that's safe, we know it works; otherwise none of you would speak your mother tongue. So you get yourself a language parent, who's somebody interested in you as a person who will communicate with you essentially as an equal, but pay attention to help you understand the message. There are four rules of a language parent. Spouses are not very good at this, OK? But the four rules are, first of all, they will work hard to understand what you mean even when you're way off beat. Secondly, they will never correct your mistakes. Thirdly, they will feed back their understanding of what you are saying so that you can respond appropriately and get that feedback and then they will use words that you know. The sixth thing you have to do, is copy the face. You got to get the muscles working right, so you can sound in a way that people will understand you. There's a couple of things you do. One is that you hear how it feels, and feel how it sounds which means you have a feedback loop operating in your face, but ideally if you can look at a native speaker and just observe how they use their face, let your unconscious mind absorb the rules, then you're going to be able to pick it up. And if you can't get a native speaker to look at, you can use stuff like this, (Female voice) Sing, song, king, stung, hung. (Chris Lonsdale) And the final idea here, the final action you need to take is something that I call "direct connect". What does this mean? Well most people learning a second language sort of take the mother tongue words and the target words and go over them again and again in their mind to try and remember them. Really inefficient. What you need to do is realise that everything you know is an image inside your mind, it's feelings, if you talk about fire, you can smell the smoke, you can hear the crackling, you can see the flames, so what you do, is you go into that imagery and all of that memory and you come out with another pathway. So I call it "same box, different path". You come out of that pathway and you build it over time, you become more and more skilled at just connecting the new sounds to those images that you already have, into that internal representation. And over time you even become naturally good at that process, that becomes unconscious. So, there are five principles that you need to work with, seven actions, if you do any of them, you're going to improve. And remember these are things under your control as the learner. Do them all and you're going to be fluent in a second language in six months. Thank you. (Applause)`

                `一次不可思议的旅程。
1604 年 10 月，夜空中出现了一些非凡的东西。毫无预兆地，一道比任何星星都明亮的光芒突然照亮了黑暗。早期天文学家将其视为未来事物的奇迹预兆。他们没有人猜到它到底是什么——一颗数千年前爆炸的遥远恒星发出的垂死之光。
这颗超新星现在被称为开普勒之星，天文学家观察了它一年多，这颗超新星帮助开创了太空探索的新时代。几年之内，伽利略·伽利雷就率先使用了望远镜，用他自己设计的望远镜来观察月球上的丘陵和山谷、太阳上的斑点、金星的相位、银河系的星星，以及最著名的，木星的卫星。第谷·布拉赫、克里斯蒂安·惠更斯和其他早期天文学的伟人很快就有了自己的发现。
我们仍然处于由这些先驱者启动的发现的黄金时代。我们现在拥有足球场大小的望远镜，可以比开普勒想象的更深入地观察太空。在过去的 60 年里，我们一直在向太空发射卫星、飞船、探测器、人类和仪器，以便进行更近距离的观察。目前，好奇号火星车正在从火星表面发回快照，菲莱着陆器正在搭乘一颗路过的彗星离开我们的太阳系。
得益于这些探索工具，我们对宇宙的了解一直在不断扩展。仅举一个例子，当欧洲航天局的盖亚任务于 2018 年结束时，其望远镜将拍摄超过 10 亿颗恒星，为我们提供有史以来绘制的最准确的三维天空地图。月亮可能正在消失，但太空探索一如既往地充满活力。
本期《新科学家：精选集》漫游了这一鼓舞人心的探索的前沿。
它将阐明宇宙中一些最深的奥秘，并帮助您以惊人的细节看到我们自己的宇宙角落。
第一章讲述了我们的太阳系之旅。与攀登火星山脉的机器人见面，参观我们附近一些最不寻常的卫星，凝视太阳表面，了解奋力穿越太阳系最后地平线的航天器。
第二章扩大视野，探索我们的家乡银河系。我们不再认为它是整个宇宙，但它的许多秘密仍然让我们无法理解，从中心的黑洞到可能与太阳一起形成的恒星。
第三章回到了我们更熟悉的——尽管仍然非常陌生——的领域，即可能散布在宇宙中的类地行星的形状。它们到底是怎样的奇异世界呢？它们——或者它们的卫星——能够支持智慧生命吗？我们怎么知道要寻找什么？
最后，第四章深入太空深处，看看其中一些最不寻常的居民，从完美到不存在的星系到比我们想象的更大的恒星。
我们可能不再依靠肉眼来观察天空，但仍有很多东西我们不知道。让《新科学家》带您探索我们知识的极限，并引导您解决将为下一个世纪的发现提供动力的问题。

                `野生的东西。
查尔斯·达尔文在《物种起源》中写道，地球上的生命充满了“无尽的最美丽、最奇妙的形式”。任何去过雨林、珊瑚礁甚至英国草地的人都知道他在说什么。
生命是耀眼的、丰富的、多样的，但又是脆弱的。
地球是我们唯一知道其存在的行星，我们有理由为它欢欣鼓舞。
本期《新科学家：精选》致力于地球上令人惊叹、迷人且最脆弱的野生动物。从热带到两极，从海洋深处到喜马拉雅山之巅，生命无处不在。
在这些页面中，您将遇到地球上最有趣的生物，并辅以令人惊叹的野生动物摄影。
在第一章中，我们从我们自己的亲属：哺乳动物开始。从最稀有的灵长类动物的困境到地球上一些最大动物的非凡社会联系，这些都是关于生存、恢复，甚至在某些情况下灭绝的故事。综合这些故事，我们可以从欧洲大型掠食者和加拿大可爱海獭的惊人卷土重来中，看到仅存的 26 只海南长臂猿的一线希望。或者他们会重蹈世界上最大的猿类和南大西洋神秘狼的覆辙吗？
在第二章中，我们飞向天空。鸟类与哺乳动物一样迷人，但在某些情况下同样面临危险。一个特别令人心酸的故事是拯救查塔姆岛黑知更鸟的行动，这是一次英勇而成功的努力，尽管它确实对鸟蛋产生了奇怪的影响。您还会遇到鹈鹕、鸬鹚、野生火鸡和一只似乎迷路了的猫头鹰。
第三章讲述的是海洋和生活在其中的迷人野兽。您是否知道，通过捕食大量的鱼和磷虾，鲸鱼使海洋变得更加富裕而不是更加贫穷？
狡猾的红魔正在占领东太平洋？或者地球上最有价值的材料之一是腐烂的海洋排泄物？我们的一位作家已经在寻找它，所以您不必这样做。
第四章让我们回到地球，探索地球上一些最奇特的植物。有些是肉食性的，似乎会吸引小蝙蝠和鼩鼱。令人难以置信的是，其他人也表现出了智慧的迹象。
第五章专门讲述寒冷、粘糊糊却又异常可爱的世界。我们了解到“拉撒路青蛙”为一群被凶猛真菌杀死的动物带来了希望，然后前往巴尔干半岛寻找世界上最大、最凶猛的穴居动物（剧透警告：这既不是很大也不是很凶猛，但非常罕见）。一路上，我们了解了一两件事：蛇从哪里来，海龟如何找到回家的路。
最奇怪、最奇妙的野生动物被留到最后。第六章讲述的是各种极端情况，从北冰洋特有的海洋独角兽到最小的壁虎、鱼类和青蛙，这些都适合人类的指甲。
地球上最大的生物体是什么？最老的？最干燥的？一切都将揭晓。

				`美洲狮是从哪里来的？
美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一只美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。
搜寻美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的，那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时看见“一只大猫”，离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮除非被逼得走投无路，是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它走到哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿以及死兔子之类的小动物。在许多地方看见了爪印，灌木丛中也发现了粘在上面的美洲狮毛。有人抱怨说夜里听见了“像猫一样的叫声”;一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢?由于全国动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏家豢养的，不知怎么设法逃出来了。搜寻工作进行了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人担心。`,

`后面的各位，你们听清楚了吗？好的，很好。你是否曾经在心里想着一个问题很久，以至于它成为了你思维的一部分？甚至成为你个性的一部分？嗯，我心中有一个问题已经很多年了，那就是：你如何才能加快学习速度？现在，这是一个有趣的问题，因为如果你加快学习速度，你就可以减少在学校的时间。如果你学得很快，你可能根本不需要去学校。现在，当我年轻的时候，学校还不错，但我发现学校经常妨碍学习，所以我心里想着这个问题：你如何才能学得更快？这一切开始于我很小的时候，我11岁的时候，我给苏联的研究人员写了一封信，询问关于睡眠教育法的情况，这是一种睡眠学习法，你拿一台录音机，把它放在床边，半夜你睡觉的时候它就会打开，你应该从中学习。这个想法不错，但不幸的是它行不通。但是，睡眠教育法确实为其他领域的研究打开了大门，从第一个问题开始，我们在学习方面有了令人难以置信的发现。从那时起，我对心理学产生了浓厚的兴趣，直到现在，我一直以多种不同的方式参与心理学研究。1981年，我去了中国，我决定在两年内达到母语水平的中文水平。现在，你需要明白，在1981年，每个人都认为中文非常非常难，西方人可以学习10年或更长时间，但永远无法真正掌握。而我则带着一个不同的想法：将当时心理学研究的所有结论应用到学习过程中。真正酷的是，六个月后，我就能说一口流利的普通话，而达到母语水平则需要更长的时间。但我环顾四周，看到来自不同国家的人都在努力学习中文，我看到中国人在学习英语和其他语言时也非常努力，所以我的问题就细化为：你如何帮助普通成年人快速、轻松、有效地学习一门新语言？现在，这是当今世界一个非常非常重要的问题。我们面临着巨大的环境挑战，我们面临着巨大的社会混乱、战争等各种挑战，如果我们无法沟通，我们将很难解决这些问题。所以我们需要能够说对方的语言，这真的非常重要。那么问题是：你该怎么做？嗯，其实这很容易。你看看周围已经能做到的人，看看已经奏效的情况，然后找出原则并加以应用。这叫做建模，我研究语言学习和建模语言学习已经有15到20年了。我的结论，我的观察是，任何成年人都可以在六个月内学会流利的第二语言。现在当我说这句话时，大多数人认为我疯了，这是不可能的。所以让我提醒大家人类进步的历史，一切都是为了扩大我们的极限。1950年，每个人都认为四分钟跑一英里是不可能的，然后罗杰·班尼斯特在1956年做到了，从那时起，距离越来越短。100年前，每个人都认为重物飞不起来。但事实并非如此，我们都知道这一点。重物如何飞行？我们利用从观察自然界（在本例中是鸟类）中学到的原理重新组织材料。今天我们走得更远，我们走得更远，所以你可以驾驶汽车。你可以花几十万美元买一辆这样的汽车。现在世界上有会飞的汽车。还有一种不同的飞行方式，我们从松鼠那里学到了。所以你需要做的就是模仿飞鼠的做法，做一套叫做翼装的衣服，然后你就可以像松鼠一样飞了。现在大多数人，很多人，我不会说每个人，但很多人认为他们不会画画。但是有一些关键原则，五个原则，你可以应用于学习绘画，你实际上可以在五天内学会绘画。所以，如果你像这样画画，你需要学习这些原则五天并加以运用，五天后你就可以画出类似这样的画。现在我知道这是真的，因为那是我的第一幅画，在运用这些原则五天后，我就能画出来。我看着这幅画，心想：“哇，这就是我全神贯注、大脑爆炸时的样子。”所以，任何人都可以在五天内学会画画，同样，按照同样的逻辑，任何人都可以在六个月内学会第二语言。如何做到？有五项原则和七项行动。可能还有其他一些，但这些绝对是核心。在我开始讲这些之前我只想谈谈两个误解，我想消除两个误解。第一个是你需要天赋。让我给你讲讲佐伊。佐伊来自澳大利亚，去了荷兰，试图学习荷兰语，非常非常努力，最后人们说：“你完全没用”，“你没有天赋”，“放弃吧”，“你浪费时间”，她非常非常沮丧。然后她遇到了这五项原则，她搬到了巴西，并运用了它们，六个月后她就能说一口流利的葡萄牙语，所以天赋并不重要。人们还认为，沉浸在一个新国家是学习语言的方法。但看看香港，看看所有在这里呆了10年的西方人，他们一句中文都不会说。看看所有生活在美国、英国、澳大利亚、加拿大的中国人，他们在那里呆了10、20年，他们不会说任何英语。沉浸式学习本身不起作用。为什么？因为溺水的人是学不会游泳的。当你不会说一种语言时，你就像个婴儿。如果你把自己置于一个成年人都在谈论你无法理解的东西的环境中，你是学不会的。那么，你需要注意哪五个原则呢？首先：四个词，注意力、意义、相关性和记忆，它们以非常非常重要的方式相互联系。尤其是当你谈论学习的时候。跟我一起穿越森林。你在森林里散步，你看到了这样的东西，树上的小标记，也许你会注意，也许你不会。你再走50米，你看到了这个，你应该注意了。再走50米，如果你没注意，你会看到这个，这时，你就注意了。你刚刚了解到这一点很重要，它之所以重要是因为它意味着这一点，任何与你生存相关的事物、任何信息都是你会关注的东西，因此你会记住它。如果它与你的个人目标有关，那么你就会关注它。如果它是相关的，你就会记住它。因此，学习语言的第一条规则、第一原则是专注于与你相关的语言内容。这让我们谈到了工具。我们通过使用工具来掌握工具，当工具与我们相关时，我们学习工具的速度最快。让我分享一个故事。键盘是一种工具。以某种方式输入中文，有方法可以做到这一点。那是一种工具。多年前，我有一位同事上夜校；周二晚上、周四晚上，每次两个小时，在家练习，她花了九个月的时间，但她没有学会打中文。有一天晚上，我们遇到了危机。我们有48小时的时间来提供中文培训手册。她得到了这份工作，我可以保证，在48小时内，她学会了中文打字，因为它很有意义，很重要，她正在使用一种工具来创造价值。因此，学习语言的第二个原则是从第一天开始就使用你的语言作为交流的工具。就像一个孩子一样。我刚到中国时，一句中文都不会说，第二周，我坐火车过夜。我花了八个小时坐在餐车里和火车上的一名警卫交谈，他不知为何对我产生了兴趣，我们整晚都用中文聊天，他画画，用手和面部表情做动作，一点一点地，我理解得越来越多。但真正酷的是，两周后，当人们在我周围说中文时，我能听懂其中的一些，而我甚至没有花任何精力去学习。那天晚上我在火车上吸收了所发生的事情，这引出了第三个原则。当你首先理解了信息，你就会无意识地掌握语言。现在这已经得到了非常充分的记录，这就是所谓的可理解输入。这方面的研究已经有20或30年了，该领域的领军人物斯蒂芬·克拉申发表了各种不同的研究，这只是其中之一。紫色条显示了不同语言测试的分数。紫色的人是通过语法和正式学习学习的人，绿色的人是通过可理解输入学习的人。所以，理解是有效的。理解是关键，语言学习不是积累大量知识。在很多方面，它与生理训练有关。我认识一位台湾女士，她在学校时英语成绩优异，一路拿A级，大学毕业后，成绩一直保持A级，后来去了美国，却发现自己听不懂别人说什么。人们开始问她：“你是聋子吗？”她确实是聋子。英语聋子。因为我们的大脑中有过滤器，可以过滤我们熟悉的声音，并过滤掉我们不熟悉的语言的声音。如果你听不见，你就不会理解，如果你听不见，你就不会理解，不理解它，你就不会学会它。所以你实际上必须能够听到这些声音。有办法做到这一点，但这是生理训练。说话需要肌肉。你的脸上有43块肌肉，你必须协调它们，才能发出别人能理解的声音。如果你曾经做过几天的新运动，你知道你的身体感觉如何吗？疼吗？如果你的脸疼，那你就做对了。最后一个原则是状态。心理生理状态。如果你悲伤、愤怒、担心、不安，你就不会学习。就这样。如果你快乐、放松、处于阿尔法大脑状态、好奇，你就会学得很快，而且具体来说，你需要容忍歧义。如果你是那种需要百分百理解你听到的每个单词的人，你会发疯的，因为你会一直非常沮丧，因为你并不完美。如果你对听懂一些单词或听不懂一些单词感到满意，只关注你理解的内容，你会没事的，很放松，而且你会学得很快。那么根据这五项原则，你要采取哪七项行动呢？第一：多听。我称之为大脑浸泡。你把自己置于一个环境中，听到无数种语言，不管你是否理解它。你在听节奏，听重复的模式，听突出的东西。（中文）泡脑子。（英文）所以，把你的大脑浸泡在里面。第二个行动是，你先理解意思，甚至在你理解单词之前。你会说：“那我怎么做呢？我不认识这些词！”好了，你明白了这些不同的姿势意味着什么。人类交流在很多方面都是肢体语言，很多肢体语言。从肢体语言中，你可以理解很多交流，因此，你正在理解，你正在通过可理解的输入获得。你也可以使用你已经知道的模式。如果你是一个会说普通话和粤语的中国人，你去越南，你会明白他们在日常对话中对你说的话的60%，因为越南语大约有30%是普通话，30%是粤语。第三个动作：开始混合。你可能从来没有想过这一点，但如果你有10个动词、10个名词和10个形容词，你可以说1000种不同的东西。语言是一个创造性的过程。婴儿会做什么？好的，“我”、“洗澡”、“现在”。好的，这就是他们交流的方式。所以开始混合吧，发挥创意，享受其中的乐趣，不必完美，只要有效就行。当你这样做的时候，你要专注于核心。这是什么意思？好吧，任何语言都是高频内容。在英语中，1000个单词涵盖了你在日常交流中要说的85%。3000个单词涵盖了你在日常对话中要说的98%。你有3000个单词，你就是在说这门语言。剩下的都是锦上添花。当你刚开始学习一门新语言时，从你的工具箱开始。第一周，用你的新语言，你会说这样的话：“你怎么说？”“我不明白”，“请重复一下”，“那是什么意思？”所有这些都是用你的目标语言说的。你把它当作一种工具，让它对你有用，学习有关这门语言的其他知识是相关的。到第二周，你应该会说这样的话：“我”、“这个”、“你”、“那个”、“给”、“你知道”、“热”、简单的代词、简单的名词、简单的动词、简单的形容词，像婴儿一样交流。到第三或第四周，你就会开始学习“粘合词”。“虽然”、“但是”、“因此”，这些都是将语言的各个部分联系在一起的逻辑转换器，让你能够表达更复杂的含义。这时你就会说话了。当你这样做的时候，你应该给自己找一个语言家长。如果你看看孩子和父母是如何互动的，你就会明白这意味着什么。当一个孩子说话时，他会使用简单的单词、简单的组合，有时相当奇怪，有时非常奇怪的发音，家庭以外的人听不懂。但父母可以。这样孩子就有了一个安全的环境，获得了自信。父母用肢体语言和简单的语言与孩子交谈，他们知道孩子能听懂。因此，您拥有一个安全的、可理解的输入环境，我们知道它是有效的；否则你们都不会说自己的母语。因此，您需要一位语言父母，他/她对您感兴趣，会与您平等地交流，但会注意帮助您理解信息。语言父母有四条规则。配偶在这方面不太擅长，好吗？但这四条规则是，首先，即使您说得非常离谱，他们也会努力理解您的意思。其次，他们永远不会纠正您的错误。第三，他们会反馈他们对您所说内容的理解，以便您可以重新理解做出适当的回应，得到反馈，然后他们就会使用你知道的单词。第六件你必须做的事情是模仿面部表情。你必须让肌肉正常工作，这样你才能发出一种人们能理解的声音。有几件事要做。一是你要听到它的感觉，感受它的声音，这意味着你的脸上有一个反馈回路，但理想情况下，如果你能看着母语人士，观察他们如何使用面部表情，让你的潜意识吸收规则，那么你就能学会它。如果你不能让母语人士看，你可以使用这样的东西，（女声）唱歌，歌，国王，刺痛，挂。（克里斯·朗斯代尔）这里的最后一个想法，你需要采取的最后一个行动是我称之为“直接连接”的东西。这是什么意思？大多数人学习第二语言时，都会把母语单词和目标单词在脑海里一遍又一遍地复习，试图记住它们。效率真的很低。你需要做的是意识到你所知道的一切都是你头脑中的图像，是感觉，如果你谈论火，你可以闻到烟味，你可以听到噼啪声，你可以看到火焰，所以你要做的是，你进入那个图像和所有的记忆，然后你从另一条路径出来。所以我称之为“同一个盒子，不同的路径”。你从那条路径出来，随着时间的推移，你越来越熟练地将新的声音与你已经拥有的图像联系起来，进入那个内部表征。随着时间的推移，你甚至会自然而然地擅长这个过程，这会变成无意识的。所以，你需要遵循五项原则，七项行动，如果你做其中任何一项，你就会进步。记住，这些都是你作为学习者可以控制的事情。把它们都做完，你将在六个月内流利地说第二语言。谢谢。（掌声）`
